# Seq2Seq Chatbot with Tensorflow

from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST) Human Language Technology Center

This is a seq2seq chatbot from the Neural Conversation Model(Vinyals, O., and Le, Q. 2015. A neural conversational model. Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, Deep Learning Workshop) implemented with Tensorflow 

## Scripts 
1. `seq2seq_wrapper.py`: seq2seq model
2. `train.py`: functions for training the module
3. `predict.py`: decoding part (beam-search)
4. `chat.py`: module for load the pre-trained module for chatting.
5. `data_utils.py`: utils functions (batch generation)

## Training
Look at `twitter-chatbot.py`. The checkpoints and summary will be saved in `logs`

## Decoding
Look at `predict.py`. Now uses random beam search.

## Chatting
A 2-layer-LSTM  model trained on twitter corpus is saved in `/pretrained_model/two`.
See `chat.py`. We incorporated this module with Flask in another project. (Flask code is not here)

| that is so cool ! ! i live in australia (: | lovely ! :) | 

## Datasets
Each dataset has separate `data.py` for preprocessing

- Twitter Dialogue Pairs from [julianser](https://github.com/julianser/hed-dlg-truncated)
Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models. Iulian V. Serban, Alessandro Sordoni, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, Joelle Pineau. 2016c. AAAI. http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04808.

+ you can add other corpus you have easily. for reference, see  `twitter-chatbot.py` and preprocessing `datasets/tweets/data.py`

## Requirements
- tensorflow 1.0.0 (higher version might have error due to tf.legacy_seq2seq)
- python 3.4
- numpy
- pandas (for loading data)
- tqdm (for preprocessing)

## Remarks
- Takes pretty long time to train (1M training pairs around 15+ hours with GPU). Decoding takes 4~5 secs in GPU, but over 60 secs in slow CPU. 
- Improvements on decoding needed (eg. rescoring, diversity promoting)
